# This script generates a Debian package where all shared library dependencies
# are bundled with the host executable such that it can be run stand-alone
# without having other packages installed. The main purpose is to be able to
# volume mount an SGX-LKL installation into a Docker container without requiring
# the container to have any runtime dependencies installed.
#
# The folder structure of the installed Debian package is as follows:
#
# /opt/sgx-lkl
#   bin/
#     sgx-lkl-run-oe
#     ...
#   lib/
#     libsgxlkl.so.signed
#     external/
#       ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
#       libdcap_quoteprov.so
#       libcurl.so.4
#       libgcc_s.so.1
#       ...
#   tools/
#
# In general, this reflects a regular SGX-LKL installation tree plus the lib/external
# folder containing all bundled libraries.
#
# Implementation notes:
#
# This script relies on the auditwheel tool from the Python packaging ecosystem.
# It is normally used to discover and bundle all dynamically linked dependencies of native
# extension modules of a Python package such that it can be distributed in binary form on the
# Python package index. This is done by constructing a hierarchical tree of
# dependencies, copying those dependencies into a common folder, and patching the
# rpaths. Here, we simply pretend to be a Python package and make use of the same
# machinery. There is a similar tool for macOS called "delocate" which works not
# just on Python packages but also plain folders, but auditwheel does not have this
# option, which is why we need to put our files into a dummy Python package and extract
# them from the resulting package file again.
#
# auditwheel copies all libraries into a <pkgname>.libs folder, however,
# because we want the files to live in lib/external we do minimal additional
# rpath patching using the patchelf tool (which auditwheel also relies upon).
#
# The package we create is fully bundled, meaning it contains all dependencies
# including glibc and the loader library. This is different from what auditwheel
# normally does as it assumes Python will run on a Linux distribution that can run
# binaries produced by an old CentOS system. This old CentOS system is described by
# a policy: https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/master/auditwheel/policy/policy.json.
# In our case, we don't make any assumptions and produce a self-contained package
# that can run on any Linux distribution. For that, we use our own policy file
# and also take an additional step to bundle the dynamic loader library (also 
# called the interpreter, or PT_INTERP) since auditwheel does not touch that and it is
# different from regular dependencies.
# 
# Automatic dependency discovery relies on dynamically linked libraries, however, the
# Azure DCAP Client library is dlopen'd by one of the Intel SGX libraries at runtime.
# Because of that, there is extra logic that deals with bundling of this library.
