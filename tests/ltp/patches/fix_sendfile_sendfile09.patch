In original test case, below two issues are found.
    1.4GB file is used for verifying the "sendfile()"
      system call. Memory in sgx-lkl environment is
      limited, hence, testing with 4GB file is not
      supported. 
    2.During setup (in setup())a check is performed
      to verify availability of 5GB free space in
      filesystem. The 5GB free space verification is
      failed because information returned by statfs()
      system call is erroneous. git hub issue 
      https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl/issues/288
      is raised
Above mentioned issues are addressed in this patch.
Below changes are performed.
    1.In this patch 4GB file size is reduced to 4MB. 
    2.5GB free space check is modified to 5MB and
      commented the check. This check has to be
      uncommented as soon as git hub issue
      https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl/issues/288
      resolved.
