In this ltp test case (testcases/kernel/syscalls/chdir/chdir04),
one of the sub test case designed to test generation of EFAULT
by passing/accessing invalid address values (“-1”) to “chdir” syscall.
Currently sgx behaviour is to call enclave abort, if address is
not within enclave address range. Because of this test program
is causing enclave abort and exiting with non-zero exit code. 

Github issue169 (https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl/issues/169)
is raised to fix this behaviour. The sub test cases which test
EFAULT error behaviour is commented/disabled until github
issue169 is fixed.
