In this ltp test case (testcases/kernel/syscalls/readlink/readlink03),
one of the sub test case designed to test generation of EFAULT
by passing/accessing invalid address values to “readlink” syscall.
Currently sgx behaviour is to call enclave abort, if address is
not within enclave address range. Because of this test program
is causing enclave abort and exiting with non-zero exit code. 

Github issue169 (https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl/issues/169)
is raised to fix this behaviour. The sub test cases which test
EFAULT error behaviour is commented/disabled until github
issue169 is fixed.
