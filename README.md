SGX-LKL
=======

SGX-LKL is a library OS designed to run unmodified Linux binaries inside SGX
enclaves. It uses the Linux Kernel Library (LKL) (https://github.com/lkl/linux)
to provide mature system support for complex applications within the enclave. A
modified version of musl (https://www.musl-libc.org) is used as C standard
library implementation. SGX-LKL has support for in-enclave user-level
threading, signal handling, and paging. System calls are handled within the
enclave by LKL when possible, and asynchronous system call support is provided
for the subset of system calls that require direct access to external resources
and are therefore processed by the host OS. The goal of SGX-LKL is to provide
system support for complex applications and managed runtimes such as the JVM
with minimal or no modifications and minimal reliance on the host OS.


Prerequisites
---------------------------------

SGX-LKL has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. To run SGX-LKL in SGX
enclaves, the Intel SGX driver (available at
https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx-driver and
https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/downloads) is required. We have
tested SGX-LKL with driver versions 1.9 to 2.5. SGX-LKL also provides a
simulation mode for which no SGX-enabled CPU is needed. Furthermore the
following packages are required to build SGX-LKL:
`make`, `gcc`, `g++`, `bc`, `python`, `xutils-dev` (for `makedepend`), `bison`,
`flex`, `libgcrypt20-dev`, `libjson-c-dev`, `automake`, `autopoint`,
`autoconf`, `pkgconf`, `libtool`, `libcurl4-openssl-dev`, `libprotobuf-dev`,
`libprotobuf-c-dev`, `protobuf-compiler`, `protobuf-c-compiler`, `libssl-dev`.

Install these with:

```
sudo apt-get install make gcc g++ bc python xutils-dev bison flex libgcrypt20-dev libjson-c-dev automake autopoint autoconf pkgconf libtool libcurl4-openssl-dev libprotobuf-dev libprotobuf-c-dev protobuf-compiler protobuf-c-compiler libssl-dev
```

Compilation has been tested with versions 5.4 and 7.3 of gcc. Older versions
might lead to compilation and/or linking errors.

### Networking support

In order for SGX-LKL applications to send and receive packets via the network, a
TAP interface is needed on the host. Create it as follows:

```
sudo ip tuntap add dev sgxlkl_tap0 mode tap user `whoami`
sudo ip link set dev sgxlkl_tap0 up
sudo ip addr add dev sgxlkl_tap0 10.0.1.254/24
```

SGX-LKL will use the IP address `10.0.1.1` by default. To change it, set the
environment variable `SGXLKL_IP4`. The name of the TAP interface is set
using the environment variable `SGXLKL_TAP`.

The interface can be removed again by running the following command:

```
sudo ip tuntap del dev sgxlkl_tap0 mode tap
```

In order to communicate with an SGX-LKL enclave from a different host and/or
allowing an application to reach other hosts, additional `iptable` rules to
forward corresponding traffic might be needed.

```
# Enable packet forwarding
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
# Forward traffic to enclave attestation endpoint
sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 56000 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.1.1:56000
# Forward traffic to enclave Wireguard endpoint
sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p udp -i eth0 --dport 56002 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.1.1:56002

# Allow forwarding to/from TAP
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -m state -d 10.0.1.0/24 --state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -m state -s 10.0.1.0/24 --state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# If enclave needs establish new connections to external hosts, masquerade
# outgoing traffic from enclave
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.1.0/24 ! -d 10.0.1.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
```

If you run an application that needs to be publicly accessible (i.e. not over
Wireguard), additional rules to forward corresponding traffic might be needed.
For example, for redis which listens on port 6379 by default:

```
# Forward traffic from host's public interface TCP port 60321 to SGX-LKL port 6379
sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -d `hostname -i` --dport 60321 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.1.1:6379
```

DNS resolution is configured via `/etc/resolv.conf` as usual, so if this is
required, ensure that a valid nameserver configuration is in place on the root
disk image, e.g. by copying the host configuration (see
`apps/miniroot/Makefile` for an example).

### Network encryption

SGX-LKL uses Wireguard for protecting network traffic between an SGX-LKL
application and other trusted nodes. See [Network
encryption](https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl/wiki/Network-encryption) for
information how to set up and use network encryption for SGX-LKL.

Building SGX-LKL manually
-------------------------

### Hardware mode

To build sgx-lkl in hardware mode run:

```
    make
    make sgx-lkl-sign
```

### Release mode

SGX-LKL has a "Release Mode" which enables/disables certain features for
hardening. In particuar, it ensures that enclave secrets are provided to
SGX-LKL over a secure channel and that an untrusted party is unable to control
SGX-LKL remotely. In release mode, the application configuration must be
provided remotely (`SGXLKL_REMOTE_CONFIG` is always set to `1`), remote control
is only available over Wireguard (`SGXLKL_REMOTE_CMD_ETH0` is always set to
`0`), and it requires that exactly one Wireguard peer is provided at startup.
You can find more information in the
[wiki](https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl/wiki/Remote-Attestation-and-Remote-Control#4-server-launch-enclave)
on why this is necessary. To build SGX-LKL in release mode run:

```
    make RELEASE=true
    make sgx-lkl-sign    # This signs the SGX-LKL enclave library as a debug enclave
```

### Simulation mode

To build sgx-lkl in simulation mode run:

```
    make sim
```

### Debug build

To build sgx-lkl with debug symbols and without compiler optimizations run
`make` with `DEBUG=true`:

```
# HW mode
make DEBUG=true
make sgx-lkl-sign
# Sim mode
make sim DEBUG=true
```


Building SGX-LKL using Docker
-----------------------------

Building SGX-LKL using Docker requires at least Docker version 17 to include
multi-stage build support. There is a script `sgx-lkl-docker.sh` to build
SGX-LKL inside a Docker container independently of the host environment:

```
./sgx-lkl-docker.sh -s build   # This builds SGX-LKL in simulation mode
```

After SGX-LKL has been built, it is possible to deploy the container with the
Java HelloWorld example on the local (or a remote) machine:

```
./sgx-lkl-docker.sh -s deploy-app jvm-helloworld
```

(Deployment on a remote Docker machine requires `docker-machine` to be set up.)

A list of options can be obtained with:

```
./sgx-lkl-docker.sh '-?'
```

Installing SGX-LKL
---------------------------------

After building SGX-LKL, build artefacts will be stored in the `build`
subdirectory. Run

```
sudo make install
```

to make SGX-LKL accessible globally. SGX-LKL will be installed in `/usr/local`
by default. To change this use `PREFIX`. For example, to install SGX-LKL in a
subdirectory `install`, run

```
sudo make install PREFIX="${PWD}/install"
```

To make the SGX-LKL tools available from any directory, add a corresponding
entry to the `PATH` environment variable:

```
PATH="$PATH:${OWD}/install/bin"
```

If SGX-LKL was installed in `/usr/local`, the correct directory is most likely
part of `PATH` already.

To uninstall SGX-LKL, run

```
sudo make uninstall
```

This will remove SGX-LKL specific artefacts from the installation directory as
well as cached artefacts of `sgx-lkl-disk` (stored in ~/.cache/sgxlkl).
Currently this assumes the installation directory to be `usr/local`. You can
provide a `PREFIX` as with `make install`.


Running applications with SGX-LKL
---------------------------------

### General

To run applications with SGX-LKL, they need to be provided as part of a disk
image. Since SGX-LKL is built on top of musl, applications are expected to be
dynamically linked against musl. musl and glibc are not fully
binary-compatible. Applications linked against glibc are therefore not
guaranteed to work with SGX-LKL. The simplest way to run an application with
SGX-LKL is to use prebuilt binaries for Alpine Linux which uses musl as its C
standard library.

### JVM

A simple Java HelloWorld example application is available in
`apps/jvm/helloworld-java`. Building the example requires `curl` and a Java 8
compiler on the host system. On Ubuntu, you can install these by running

```
sudo apt-get install curl openjdk-8-jdk
```

To build the disk image, run

```
cd apps/jvm/helloworld-java
make
```

This will compile the HelloWorld Java example, create a disk image with an
Alpine mini root environment, add a JVM, and add the HelloWorld.class file.

To run the HelloWorld java program on top of SGX-LKL inside an enclave, run

```
sgx-lkl-java ./sgxlkl-java-fs.img HelloWorld
```

`sgx-lkl-java` is a simple wrapper around `sgx-lkl-run` which sets some common
JVM arguments in order to reduce its memory footprint. It can be found in the
`<sgx-lkl>/tools` directory. For more complex applications, SGX-LKL or JVM
arguments might have to be adjusted, e.g. to increase the enclave size or the
size of the JVM heap/metaspace/code cache, or to enable networking support
by providing a TAP/TUN interface via `SGXLKL_TAP`.

If the application runs successfully, you should see an output like this:

```
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Can't detect initial thread stack location - find_vma failed
Hello world!
```

Note: The warning is caused by the fact that the JVM is trying to receive
information about the process's virtual memory regions from `/proc/self/maps`.
While SGX-LKL generally supports the `/proc` file system in-enclave,
`/proc/self/maps` is currently not populated by SGX-LKL. This does not affect
the functionality of the JVM.

### Running applications from the Alpine Linux repository

Alpine Linux uses musl as its standard C library. SGX-LKL can support a large
number of unmodified binaries available through the Alpine Linux repository.
For an example on how to create the corresponding disk image and how to run the
application, the example in `apps/miniroot` can be used as a template. Running

```
make
```

will create an Alpine mini root disk image that can be passed to sgx-lkl-run.
`buildenv.sh` can be modified to specify APKs that will be part of the disk
image. After creating the disk image, applications can be run on top of SGX-LKL
using `sgx-lkl-run`. Using redis as an example (the APK `redis` is listed in
the example `buildenv.sh` file in `apps/miniroot`), redis-server can be
launched as follows:

```
SGXLKL_TAP=sgxlkl_tap0 sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-miniroot-fs.img /usr/bin/redis-server --bind 10.0.1.1
```

The readme file in `apps/miniroot` contains more detailed information on how to
build custom disk images manually.

### Cross-compiling applications for SGX-LKL

For applications with a complex build process and/or a larger set of
dependencies it is easiest to use the unmodified binaries from the Alpine Linux
repository as described in the previous section. However, it is also possible
to cross-compile applications on non-musl based Linux distributions (e.g.
Ubuntu) and create a minimal disk image that only contains the application and
its dependencies. An example of how to cross-compile a C application and create
the corresponding disk image can be found in `apps/helloworld`. To build the
disk image and execute the application with SGX-LKL run

```
make sgxlkl-disk.img
sgx-lkl-run sgxlkl-disk.img /app/helloworld
```

Run the following command in `apps/miniroot` to see a number of other
applications you should be able to execute. Keep in mind that we currently have
no support for forking, so multi-process applications will not work.

```
sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-miniroot-fs.img /bin/ls /usr/bin
```

### Creating SGX-LKL disk images with sgx-lkl-disk

While it is possible to create disk images manually or with self-written
Makefiles as described above, SGX-LKL comes with the helper tool
`sgx-lkl-disk`. It can be found in the `tools` directory but will also be
installed alongside `sgx-lkl-run` on the system. It can be used to create,
check, mount, and unmount SGX-LKL disk images. To see all options, run

```
sgx-lkl-disk --help
```

The tool has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and 18.04. `sgx-lkl-disk` will
need superuser rights for some operations, e.g. temporarily mounting/unmounting
disk images.

#### Creating Alpine-based disk images

To create a disk image, use the `create` action. In addition, `sgx-lkl-disk`
expects the disk image size to be specified via `--size=<SIZE>` and the disk
image file name. Lastly, you will need to specify the source of the image.

In order to build an image with one or more applications available in the
Alpine package repository, use the `--alpine=<pkgs>` flag. For example, to
create an image with redis installed, run:

```
sgx-lkl-disk create --size=50M --alpine="redis" sgxlkl-disk.img
# Run with
SGXLKL_TAP=sgxlkl_tap0 sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-disk.img /usr/bin/redis-server --bind 10.0.1.1
```

Or to create a disk image with memcached, run

```
sgx-lkl-disk create --size=50M --alpine="memcached" sgxlkl-disk.img
# Run with
SGXLKL_TAP=sgxlkl_tap0 sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-disk.img /usr/bin/memcached --listen=10.0.1.1 -u root --extended=no_drop_privileges -vv
```

If you need to add additional data to a disk image, `--copy=<path>` can be used
to copy files from the host to the disk image. For example, to create a disk
image with the Alpine Python package together with a custom Python application,
run:

```
# When --copy points to a directory, the contents of the directory are copied
# to the root of the file system.
tree my-python-root
> my-python-root
> ├── app
> │   ├── myapp.py
> │   └── util.py

sgx-lkl-disk create --size=100M --alpine="python" --copy=./my-python-root sgxlkl-disk.img
# Run with
sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-disk.img /usr/bin/python /app/myapp.py
```

#### Creating Docker-based disk images

`sgx-lkl-disk` can also build disk images from Dockerfiles with the `--docker`
flag, e.g. when an application needs to be compiled manually. Note that SGX-LKL
applications still need to be linked against musl libc, so a good starting
point is an Alpine Docker base image. To build an SGX-LKL disk image from a
Dockerfile, run:

```
sgx-lkl-disk create --size=100M --docker=MyDockerfile sgxlkl-disk.img
```

#### Creating plain disk images

If all that is needed is a plain disk image based on files existing on the
host, the `--copy` flag can be used on its own as well:

```
sgx-lkl-disk create --size=50M --copy=./my-root sgxlkl-disk.img
```

#### Disk encryption

SGX-LKL supports disk encryption via the *dm-crypt* subsystem in the Linux
kernel. Typically encryption for a disk can be setup via the `cryptsetup` tool.
`sgx-lkl-disk` provides an `--encrypt` option to simplify this process. To
create an encrypted disk image with default options run

```
sgx-lkl-disk create --size=50M --encrypt --key-file --alpine="" sgxlkl-disk.img.enc
# Run with
SGXLKL_HD_KEY=./sgxlkl-disk.img.enc.key sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-disk.img.enc /bin/echo "Hello World"
```

In this example, `sgx-lkl-disk` automatically generates a 512 byte key file,
uses "AES-XTS Plain 64" as a cipher/mode and "SHA256" for hashing. The cipher
and hash algorithm is stored as metadata in a LUKS header on disk.
`sgx-lkl-disk` provides a number of options to customize this. See
`sgx-lkl-disk --help` for more information.

#### Disk integrity protection

In order to provide disk/data integrity, SGX-LKL supports both *dm-verity*
(read-only) and *dm-integrity* (read/write). These can be combined with disk
encryption (*dm-integrity* can currently only be used together with --encrypt).
For example, to create a read-only encrypted disk image with integrity
protection via *dm-verity*, you can run

```
sgx-lkl-disk create --size=50M --encrypt --key-file --verity --alpine="" sgxlkl-disk.img.enc.vrt
# Run with
SGXLKL_HD_VERITY=./sgxlkl-disk.img.enc.vrt.roothash SGXLKL_HD_KEY=./sgxlkl-disk.img.enc.vrt.key sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-disk.img.enc.vrt /bin/echo "Hello World"
```

To create an encrypted and integrity-protected disk that uses HMAC-SHA256 for
authenticated encryption and supports both reads and writes, you can run

```
# --integrity requires a host kernel version 4.12 or greater and cryptsetup version 2.0.0 or greater
sgx-lkl-disk create --size=50M --encrypt --key-file --integrity --alpine="" sgxlkl-disk.img.enc.int
# Run with
SGXLKL_HD_KEY=./sgxlkl-disk.img.enc.int.key sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-disk.img.enc.int /bin/echo "Hello World"
```

`sgx-lkl-disk` relies on `cryptsetup` for setting up encryption and integrity
protection. For more information on cryptsetup as well as
dm-crypt/dm-verity/dm-integrity see
https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/DMCrypt.


### Configuring SGX-LKL

#### Enclave size

With SGX, the enclave size is fixed at creation/initialization time. By
default, SGX-LKL uses a heap size that will fit into the EPC (together with
SGX-LKL itself). However, for many applications this might be insufficient. In
order to increase the size of the heap, use the `SGXLKL_HEAP` parameter:

```
SGXLKL_TAP=sgxlkl_tap0 SGXLKL_HEAP=200M SGXLKL_KEY=../../../build/config/enclave_debug.key sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-miniroot-fs.img /usr/bin/redis-server --bind 10.0.1.1

```

Whenever `SGXLKL_HEAP` is specified, it is also necessary to specify
`SGXLKL_KEY` which will be discussed in the next section.

Note that due to the limited Enclave Page Cache (EPC) size, performance might
degrade for applications with a large memory footprint due to paging between
the EPC and regular DRAM.

#### Enclave signing

Every enclave must be signed by its owner before it can be deployed. Without a
signature, it is not possible to initialize and run an SGX enclave. As seen in
the example above, a key can be specified via the `SGXLKL_KEY` parameter.
During the build process of SGX-LKL, a default 3072-bit RSA development/debug
key pair is generated. The corresponding key file is stored at
`build/config/enclave_debug.key`. This key is also used to generate a default
signature which is embedded into the SGX-LKL library and is used in case
`SGXLKL_HEAP` is not set. Anytime `SGXLKL_HEAP` is set or a custom key should
be used, `SGXLKL_KEY` must point to a valid key file. To generate a new key
(file), the `tools/gen_enclave_key.sh` script can be used:

```
tools/gen_enclave_key.sh <path-to-new-key-file>
```

#### Other configuration options

SGX-LKL has a number of other configuration options for e.g. configuring the
in-enclave scheduling, network configuration, or debugging/tracing. To see all
options, run

```
sgx-lkl-run --help
```

Note that for the debugging options to have an effect, SGX-LKL must be built
with `DEBUG=true`.


Remote attestation
---------------------------------
SGX-LKL provides capabilities for remote attestation including support for
Intel Attestation Service (IAS) verification. See [Remote Attestation and
Remote
Control](https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl/wiki/Remote-Attestation-and-Remote-Control)
for information on how to remotely attest an SGX-LKL application and how to
provide enclave secrets securely.


Debugging SGX-LKL (applications)
---------------------------------

SGX-LKL provides a wrapper around gdb. To build it, run `setup.sh` in the `gdb`
subdirectory. This will create the wrapper `sgx-lkl-gdb`. sgx-lkl-gdb
automatically loads the SGX-LKL gdb plugin which ensures that debug symbols (if
available) are loaded correctly. In addition, when running in HW mode,
sgx-lkl-gdb uses the corresponding SGX debug instructions to read from and
write to enclave memory. Example:

```
SGXLKL_TAP=sgxlkl_tap0 ../../gdb/sgx-lkl-gdb --args sgx-lkl-run ./sgxlkl-miniroot-fs.img /usr/bin/redis-server --bind 10.0.1.1
```

Note: SGX-LKL should be built in debug mode for full gdb support:

```
# HW debug mode
make DEBUG=true
make sgx-lkl-sign

# Sim debug mode
make sim DEBUG=true
```

Also note that SGX-LKL does support applications that use the `CPUID` and
`RDTSC` instructions. However, since `CPUID` and `RDTSC` are not permitted
within SGX enclaves, gdb will catch resulting SIGILL signals and pause
execution by default. SGX-LKL handles these signals transparently. Continue
with `c`/`continue` or instruct gdb not to stop for `SIGILL` signals (`handle
SIGILL nostop`). Be careful though as this includes `SIGILL` signals caused by
other illegal instructions. Similarly, for applications that define their own
signal handler for `SIGSEGV` signals, gdb will pause execution. When
continuing, SGX-LKL will pass on the signal to the in-enclave signal handler
registered by the application.

Take a look in the
[wiki](https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl/wiki/Debugging-and-Profiling) for more
information on debugging, tracing and profiling.
